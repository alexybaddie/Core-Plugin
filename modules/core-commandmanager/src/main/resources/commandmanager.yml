# This configuration allows you to manage commands from any plugin or module.
# Each key under "commands" is the original command name (without the leading slash).

# replace: (string) The new command name to replace the original command.
#          Leave empty (or as an empty string) if you do not want to change the command name.
# aliases: (list) A list of aliases to add to the command.
#
# Examples:
